I will be making some Testing in this project, and I will be using Robotic Process Automation

--Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the same way that a person would execute a process.

The project will be opened using UIPATH, where the automation will be implemented.

Actions to be performed:
1. Login 
2. Category
    * Creat Category
    * Delete Categories
    * Read Category
    * update Category
   
3. Device
    * Create Device
    * Delete Device
    * Read
    * Update
   
4. Zones
     * Delete Zones
     * Create Zones 
     * Read Zones
     * Update Zones

All the tests for the above can be found in their respective folders.

The tests for the above will be recorded in the excel file which will be updated everytime the automation is runned.
